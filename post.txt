üîÅ Flow: Sending JSON Data from Frontend (Axios) to Backend (Express + express.json())
1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend prepares the data
User fills out a form or data is generated (e.g., { title: "My Post", description: "This is content" }).

This is held in JavaScript object form on the frontend.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Axios sends POST request
Axios is used on the frontend: axios.post('/api/posts', data)

Axios automatically:

Converts the JS object into a JSON string

Sets headers like:

Content-Type: application/json

Accept: application/json

Sends the JSON string in the body of the HTTP request

3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend receives the HTTP request
The Express backend has middleware: app.use(express.json())

This middleware:

Listens for incoming requests with Content-Type: application/json

Automatically parses the raw JSON string in the body

Converts it into a usable JavaScript object

Attaches that object to req.body

4Ô∏è‚É£ Route handler processes the data
Express route (e.g., app.post('/api/posts', handler)) accesses the data via req.body

Example: req.body.title will contain "My Post"

The server can now:

Validate the data

Save it to a database

Modify or log it

5Ô∏è‚É£ Backend sends a response
After processing, Express sends a response like:

A success message

Or the newly created object

Typically sent using res.json(...)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Axios receives and parses the response
Axios automatically parses any JSON in the response

Axios gives you:

response.data ‚Üí contains the object or message returned from the server

response.status ‚Üí contains HTTP status (e.g., 201)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend handles the result
The frontend:

Reads response.data

Updates the UI (e.g., shows confirmation, clears the form, redirects)

üß† Summary Table
Step	Location	What Happens
1Ô∏è‚É£	Frontend	JS object is created with user input
2Ô∏è‚É£	Frontend	Axios sends JSON in POST body with correct headers
3Ô∏è‚É£	Backend	express.json() middleware parses JSON ‚Üí req.body is a JS object
4Ô∏è‚É£	Backend	Route reads req.body, processes or stores data
5Ô∏è‚É£	Backend	Response is sent back (usually in JSON)
6Ô∏è‚É£	Frontend	Axios parses response JSON ‚Üí available in response.data
7Ô∏è‚É£	Frontend	UI is updated based on server response
